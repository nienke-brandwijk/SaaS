# General information

We want to create an application that will help to integrate you into the knitting world. We don’t want to teach you how to knit, but how to navigate this world. 
We also want to support beginners by showing where to find tutorials and patterns that are perfect for first-time knitters. We’ll help you understand the jargon of the knitting world, introduce you to the materials you might need, and guide you through starting a pattern correctly and interpreting its requirements. 
On top of that, we offer easy-to-use calculators to help you figure out exactly what materials you'll need for your projects. And for those who already have a foot in the door, we want to help spark their creativity, through vision boards, fresh project ideas, and helping them navigate the vast amount of information available in the knitting world to bring their ideas to life. 
We want to help people feel less overwhelmed by all the information out there, and bring more creativity and knitting fun into the world.
